TASK -1 ELEVATE LABS:
I WANTED TO DO DATA CLEANING IN PYTHON
SIMPLY EXPLAING WHAT WE DID:
1.INITIALLY THE DATA SET HAD MANY UNREQUIRE VALUES
2.WE REMOVED UNNAMED COLUMNS
3.WE REMOVED DUPLICATE DATA
4.WE REMOVED THE ROW WITH NAN VALUES 
5.WE SAVED THE NEW FILE IN DATA
6.BEFORE CLEANINF df.shape -(8809, 26)
7.AFTER CLEANING df.shape -(5699, 12)
8.CLEAN DATA OBTAINED 





Interview Questions Related To Above Task:
1. What are missing values and how do you handle them?

Missing values are absent data in a dataset, often represented by `NaN`. Handle them by removing rows/columns (`dropna()`) or filling them with a default value or statistic (`fillna()`).

*2. How do you treat duplicate records?**

Duplicate records are repeated rows, which can be handled by removing them using `drop_duplicates()` while keeping the first or last occurrence.

3. Difference between dropna() and fillna() in Pandas?**

`dropna()`** removes rows or columns with missing values, while **`fillna()`** fills missing values with a specific value or statistic.

4. What is outlier treatment and why is it important?
  
Outlier treatment identifies extreme data points, which can distort analysis. It's important to remove or adjust them to improve model accuracy.

5. Explain the process of standardizing data.

Standardizing data scales features to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1, ensuring fair comparison between variables with different units.

6. How do you handle inconsistent data formats (e.g., date/time)?
  
Inconsistent data formats (e.g., date/time) can be handled by converting to a standard format using `pd.to_datetime()` or similar methods.

7. What are common data cleaning challenges?
 
Common data cleaning challenges include handling missing data, duplicates, inconsistent formats, and outliers.

8. How can you check data quality?
  
Data quality can be checked by inspecting for missing values, duplicates, consistency, and accuracy using descriptive statistics and visualizations.
